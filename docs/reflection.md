# Reflection
- What did you learn about GitHub and project planning?
  - This is my first time learning and using the Projects feature.
  - Unrelated to GitHub, I learned about the existence of the foundational formula of rockets.
- What was challenging or fun? If you had more time, what would you improve?
  - I had fun using the Projects feature for the first time and practicing Git in the command line more helped with re-enforcing my skills.
  - If I had more time, I would improve by adding unit conversion, impulse input, fuel density, multi-stage calculations but I do not have time to learn about these.
